# Reservoirs

A reservoir is any human-engineered vessel that can house or otherwise contain a quantity of value - whether material, energy, animal, or human. Reservoirs are typically associated with a facility, though they may provide their own services that are separate from those provided by their host facility.

Reservoirs span a very wide range of types.

Physical reservoirs are spaces - enclosed or not, fully engineered or semi-natural - that store a quantity of material. These materials can be basic commodities or highly manufactured technology products, and the conditions, duration, and purpose of their storage can all vary.
