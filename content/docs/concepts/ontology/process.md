# Processes

A process refers to any naturally occurring physical, chemical, or biological transformation. The inclusion of natural processes alongside human activities is a clear indication of the fact that Totality aims to model the human and environmental layers of the planetary system as one, without rendering either sphere as subordinate to the other or "external".

At the same time, and in contrast to the other node types - facilities, reservoirs, and resources - Totality makes no attempt to capture or describe all of the natural processes on the planet. Rather, the platform includes those processes that directly interact with other nodes and which therefore must be represented in order for the system to provide an accurate and complete description of the planetary system as it relates to human civilization.

*Physical processes* that may be recorded in Totality include changes in water phase - for example, the seasonal melting of a snowpack, the retreat of a glacier, or the evaporation of water from a lake. 

*Chemical processes* include (elements of) the nitrogen and carbon cycles, the weathering of rocks, oxidizing of metals, and other geochemical unfoldings.

*Biological processes* might involve the soil cycle, decomposition, forest maturation, animal population growth and declines, photosynthesis, and many others.
