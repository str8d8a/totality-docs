## Unapologetic Lumping

> Splitters make very small units – their critics say that if they can tell two animals apart, they place them in different genera...and if they cannot tell them apart, they place them in different species. Lumpers make large units – their critics say that if a carnivore is neither a dog nor a bear, they call it a cat.

-- George Simpson, "The Principles of Classification and a Classification of Mammals"

Totality is unabashedly a lumping enterprise. While it is necessary to draw some distinctions in the world (and to maintain enough information to allow downstream users to make finer distinctions as required by their application), Totality itself aims to make do with as few concepts and categories as it can. 

This dictated by aesthetic concerns, to be sure, but also by practical constraints: as a massively multiplayer platform, Totality must be legible to people of many different backgrounds and motivations. Every additional complexity in its external face will reduce the number who are willing and able to engage with it - whether as contributors or consumers.

The concepts and entities explained here therefore constitute the minimal set that is capable of representing the natural and man-made world without truly ugly contortions.

## Types

Totality attempts to describe the natural and man-made worlds with as few concepts as possible.
