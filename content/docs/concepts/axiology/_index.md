# The Theory (And Practice) Of Value

Axiology is often described as the theory of value - both what is morally and ethically right, as well as what is intrinsically good (often shorthanded as "beauty). In Totality, we seek to create a system that helps our society to answer these questions: What do we value? How do our built systems embody those values? How can we enact new policies and programs to maximize these outcomes? What tools can we provide to help individuals make better decisions.

In addition to delivering functionality that bears on axiological reasoning, Totality is itself software that is *for* something - in particular, for the health and resilience of life on earth. This is its primary goal, and all of the decisions about its design flow from this starting place. In other words, Totality has a strong axiological stance - it is an embodiment of a set of opinions about what is worth doing.

But there is more to say beyond this blunt statement of intent, because in any real-world system there are tradeoffs. Even though many situations are not zero sum, there are always key aspects of a situation that demand choices - about priority and focus, and often literal resource allocation as well.

How do we know what do we care about? It has long been noted that stated preferences - what we say we value and believe - are often much less reliable than so-called revealed preferences - how we act when we have skin in the game. Government budgets, for example, tell us much more about a society's priorities than rhetoric. Economic and financial measures - GDP, stock prices, compensation - also shed light in a way that PR releases and mission statements do not. The design and evolution of software platforms lay bare the goals of their makers and owners.

Below are the basic value statements behind the design and development of Totality, with the obvious caveat that these points are only significant to the extent that they are implemented in the actual construction of the platform.

## Software for Civilization

Not for individuals (consumers), or for businesses (enterprise), or for the public sector. Also a different relationship with users: to the extent that individuals will interact with the platform - and they will - their experience is important, both for its own sake and because it is critical to the success of the platform as a whole.

But the platform itself is pitched to the needs of civilization, a level of organization that is larger than any entity for which software has been written before.

## Accessibility Maximalism

Why have systems like Totality not already emerged? The existing contexts in which software systems of its scale and ambition have all carried incentives that are directly at odds with its emergence - that is, they have all contained specific pressures that have guided their progeny in other directions. (Examples: independent or venture-backed, internal growth initiatives, government initiatives).

In particular, none of these environments are capable of producing - are not interested in producing - software platforms that are both sustainable and available for the widest possible range of uses.

The closest may be Google products such as Google Maps - high quality, broadly available, probably sustainable. But there are still many uses which are effectively banned, and in particular any use which requires broader access patterns. This is even more true in adjacent products such as street view, where many commercial derivatives are effectively prohibited through API access patterns.

In general, any business or organization that does not place as its first priority the broad dissemination of high quality data will place significant restrictions on the access and use of the data it does provide. This is because data is, first and foremost, an early input to value-generating activities. Any entity that seeks to maximize its value generation (and capture) will therefore reserve for itself certain internal uses or distribution channels. While this makes perfect sense from the point of view of the entity, it is anathema to the creation of a reliable, sustainable, high-quality public good.

## Platform First

There is a strong bias in the (venture backed) startup world toward vertical solutions, meaning the development of software products that deliver value to a specific, well-defined cohort of users (and their associated buyers). This is in contrast to horizontal solutions, which provide a certain degree of value to a wide range of users who span different applications, domain, use cases, or sectors. The conventional wisdom is that a company or organization with  "platform" ambitions should first prove its mettle in or more verticals before extending itself horizontally. And this isn't wrong, especially in the context of a company that has raised venture-type funding - and that, in doing so, has taken on the growth expectations of venture investors.

Totality directly questions this wisdom: its goal is the broadest possible dissemination of high-quality knowledge about the planet's natural and man-made realms. It is not that Totality is not interested in the applications of its output - but, rather, that the more lucrative or straightforwardly profitable of these applications must not be allowed to crowd out those whose benefits primarily accrue in the environmental, civic, or cultural sectors. In other words, the operating model must include a radical commitment to *not* attempting to capture most of the value that is created. This is, needless to say, entirely and understandably at odds with most investors' expectations.

## Independent and self-sustaining

Given the above admonitions, one might assume that Totality should seek support from grant-making entities such as foundations or even the government. But these entities have their own agendas, theses, and processes. Sustaining grant-based funding is notoriously time consuming and unpredictable, and is therefore not a good fit for an effort that aims to build a multi-decade, institutional public good.

If equity investment and foundation-style support are both off the table, then what is left? While it's true that there are no solutions ready to be pulled off the shelf, there are many reasons to believe that Totality can reach and maintain self-sustaining status early in its lifecycle.
