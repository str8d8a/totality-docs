# Designing On Totality

1. Space is the join
    - Data that is situated in space has a unique advantage over all other data: no matter how or why it was originally collected, observations can be connected ("joined" in database language) by latitude, longitude (and height, and sometimes time)
    - Spatial data is therefore different from other, more abstract collections, because it carries its own index with it; the value of this is central
2. Value derives from combination
    - Building on the previous, spatial data offers opportunities for combination across multiple layers and sources that vastly exceeds other domains
    - It is in these combinations that breakthrough value emerges, as questions can often be answered as soon as the right combination of observations is brought into mutual alignment
3. No secret languages
    - Expertise is worthy of respect, but only if it is used to improve outcomes rather than to exclude newcomers from participating
    - Much of the jargon and concepts in a field have analogs in other domains, and we should seek these out in order to build bridges
    - Solving the problems of an interdependent world will require collaboration between communities of expertise that have never worked together before
4. Mind your uncertainties
    - Data is produced by people, processes, and machines, all of which are specific and fallible
    - At the most basic level, never lose sight of the data generating process and its impact on the observations in hand
    - More specifically, track the uncertainty associated with your data throughout the lifecycle of its use
5. Don't breathe the exhaust fumes
    - Data is not god-given; it is created
    - If you don't have the data you need, or if you need to use fancy math, consider collecting it
6. Embrace sousveillance capitalism
    - Sousveillance (observing the powerful from below) is morally very different from surveillance; we must not shy away from sousveillance because of our righteous discomfort with surveillance
    - Sousveillance, especially when pervasive, is a massive check on power and abuse
    - If we only knew what we could know by seeing...
7. Claim the commons
    - There is immense value waiting to be recognized if we have the courage and wisdom to ascertain our surroundings
    - There will be resistance from powerful interests as this value is captured by the public; this is an existential fight, and we must not shy from it
8. Stop at the front door
    - Contra surveillance capitalism, our interest does not extend into the household or to individual decisions
    - We enable better decisions at the micro level by improving the information environment in which those decisions are made
9. Remember that we are unseeing, not evil
    - The most destructive narrative that reactionary and predatory forces push is that humans are fundamentally greedy, selfish, brutish - that these qualities are innate and universal
    - By this reading, we are failing to respond to the climate crisis because it is not in our nature to act collectively to do so
    - But we are not acting because we are not aware of the situation - not at the civilizational level; the task is to build the senses we need
10. Perception is the ballgame
    - At the individual level, it is easy to understand the situation, but often hard to know what to do
    - But at a societal level, it is hard to properly apprehend our circumstances; once this awareness is achieved, the proper response will be almost automatic
