# Building With Totality

Totality is, first and foremost, meant to be used. If you are reading this, we want to help you to get the most from the platform. Unlike many other data sources, Totality aims to provide a top-notch service for as many applications as possible - regardless of ability to pay. For more about why the system is designed and built this way, check out our [Concept](/docs/concepts) documentation, and in particular the section on [Axiology](/docs/concepts/axiology).
