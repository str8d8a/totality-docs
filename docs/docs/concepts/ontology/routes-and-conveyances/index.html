<p>The four node types describe the stocks (reservoirs, resources) and transformations (facilities, processes) of materials, animals, and people, as well as the services they provide through their operation and being.</p>
<p>But matter and energy of all kinds must move from one place to another in order for the planetary system to function. These movements are both a consequence of natural processes and intentional human activity, and Totality is concerned with both of these categories.</p>
<p>Totality uses two classes to represent these movements: routes and conveyances.</p>
<p><strong>Routes</strong> describe any path by which energy or material can travel. Routes include engineered structures like roads and railways, natural courses such as rivers and streams, and de facto rights of way such as those used by commercial air travel and oceangoing ships. I.e., some routes have a specific geographic extent, while others are defined in functional and operational terms.</p>
<p><strong>Conveyances</strong> are vehicles or other machinery that are used to transport people, animals, and material from one node to another. Conveyances include many commercial trucks, aircraft, and ships, as well as locomotives and their associated rolling stock. Not all vehicles are considered conveyances from the point of view of Totality representation; private vehicles are not represented in Totality, nor are vehicles that are used within a node. For example, trucks and other machinery that are used within the confines of a mining operation are better thought of as components of the mining facility.</p>
<p>In some cases, routes operate alone to transport energy and materials, while in others conveyances travel along appropriate routes to perform this function.</p>

<p>From the point of view of Totality, it is the <em>result</em> of transportation that is most important, rather than the details of how it occurred. This means that, for example, the flight plan of a cargo plane - its altitude, waypoints, approach pattern, and so on - is much less important than its origin, destination, and schedule. Vehicles such as commercial airplanes and cargo ships are easy to track, and their movements can provide rich insight into the planetary system, but their specific maneuvers are not of primary importance.</p>
