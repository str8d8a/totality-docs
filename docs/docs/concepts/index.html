<p>Totality is a software system, but its most important aspects are its philosophy, principles, and goals. Totality uses technologies that are widely available, cost-effective, and scalable: the public cloud, edge devices, remote sensing, mobile computing, and so on. But it combines these familiar pieces in new ways and, in particular, to new ends.</p>
<p>Totality is made from the same bits and atoms as many other systems; if you were to look at its &ldquo;parts list&rdquo;, everything would look quite pedestrian. But purpose and material are quite different concerns, and it is in purpose where Totality is truly new.</p>
<p>In classical philosophy of science, questions are divided into three domains.</p>
<p><a href="../../docs/concepts/axiology"><strong>Axiology</strong></a> includes questions of value: what is important? How are different notions and degrees of importance compared, and how might decisions be made between options when resources are scarce? Axiology includes both <strong>ethics</strong> - what is right action? what ought we to do? - and <strong>aesthetics</strong> - what is &ldquo;beautiful&rdquo;, meaning worthy on its own terms?</p>
<p><a href="../../docs/concepts/epistemology"><strong>Epistemology</strong></a> concerns what we know, how we come to know it, how we should relate to that knowledge. Crucially, epistemology also covers uncertainty - how sure or unsure should we be about a claim? When should we feel comfortable acting, and when should we wait and seek out more evidence?</p>
<p><a href="../../docs/concepts/ontology"><strong>Ontology</strong></a> is all about the nature of being - what exists, the categories that things fall into, and how items and their categories interact. In computer science and IT, the concept of ontologies has been extended to include some very detailed domain-specific hierarchies; we, though, are more interested in the fundamental idea of ontology.</p>
<h2 id="the-philosophy-of-totality">The Philosophy of Totality</h2>
<p>All three of these lenses can be applied to understanding Totality as an overall system.</p>
<p>Starting with ontology, which is a common concern for software and data systems; all data modeling is a <em>de facto</em> (and frequently <em>de jure</em>) ontological exercise - a dividing up of the modeled universe into entities and their relations.</p>
<p>Epistemology, too, is not foreign to computer science, though it makes fewer explicit appearances in the literature and consciousness of the field. This is largely a result of the relevant history: early computer systems were developed within controlled, institutional contexts. While the personal and mobile computing eras have both been underway for some time, databases have remained relatively centralized. But this obscures the fact that the information within them is increasingly created, curated, and consumed by many, many people. And it is widely understood now that our methods for sense-making and truth evaluation have fallen way behind our tools for gathering and disseminating that information.</p>
<p>And finally, axiology has been largely absent from the computing discussion. Or, more accurately, it has been confined to specific corners of the discourse. Computing ethics has been narrowly construed, mostly concerned with how software systems should be built and tested in order to prevent harm to users and bystanders. This is important - radiation overdoses, rockets exploding from control failures, and privacy breaches are all essential to avoid. But if these specific and easily characterizable harms are the primary focus, then systems that function &ldquo;properly&rdquo; can still cause harm - or fail to deliver the benefits that differently-motivated alternatives would bring. Crucially, many of these ethical discussions happen outside of the software and hardware practitioner communities.</p>
<p>Aesthetics has a rich basis in computing, starting from the earliest days of system design and extending into the present day. Computer scientists and software engineers have endless judgments about the beauty, elegance, and rightness of the languages and technologies they use. But these judgments only rarely extend from the internal structure of those systems to their brodaer impacts on the world.</p>
<p>Totality draws from all of these wells. As a system for capturing and making available complete, accurate, and up-to-date information about many aspects of the planet, it is clearly dependent on both ontological and epistemological concepts. Like any system which attempts to model key aspects of the real world, Totality&rsquo;s method of dividing the world into entities and their relationships is central to its function and performance. But as a system that incorporates observations from an extremely diverse array of sources, Totality must also take epistemological concerns very seriously. How should observations be weighted on an individual basis? How do different observations - different sources, different collection methods, different times - be combined and compared? How does reliability change over time? When should beliefs be called into question as a result of knew observations? For Totality to achieve its goals, the system must include specific facilities to address these and other questions about the nature and reliability of the information it processes.</p>
<p>And finally, Totality cannot be properly understood or further developed without intense focus on axiological concerns - what is valuable, what should be done, and how tradeoffs should be made along the way. While this is unusual today, it should become less so. As a new discipline, computing - and, especially, networked computing - has been primarily concerned with what is possible (and how to build it). But it is time, probably past time, for questions about what <em>should</em> be built to take center stage. If we take for granted the fact that networked computing systems can have a huge effect on every aspect of our lives and the health of our planet, we must foreground the questions of where and to what aims we should be applying our efforts.</p>
<p>Totality is, today, unusual in its preoccupation with these issues, but this is intended to be a point of leadership rather than long term differentiation. Software is powerful, and it is indeed eating the world. But the honeymoon is over, and it is time to act like it.</p>
