<p>As a civilization, we need to make a leap.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The idea that there is a human economy separate from or above the rest of the planet, apart from nature, is simply wrong; it has also been incredibly destructive. Humans have made from the elements and energy around us many wonderful new things (and some horrific ones as well); but, even so, the entirety of the human economy is contained within the natural world. All of the attempts I know of to act as if the economy were separate from the world in which it operates have led to ecological and human disasters (though some are of such slowness we perceive them not as ruinous but simply as change over time).</p>
<p>We’re not in charge, however powerful we may be (we are not, contrary to the saying, “as gods”). For one thing, the stability of nearly all the systems we’ve created depends on the flows of natural systems which we still at best incompletely understand, and which are all much too large for us to control (influence, yes: control, no). A host of ideas have been put forward about how humanity might change this basic fact — that we are, entirely, a subset of nature; that we are part of this planet, not just on it — but all of them remain, at this point, in the realm of handwaving; and, if history is our guide, attempts to pursue them will mostly result in the catastrophic failures of hubris&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>But to learn to work on planet-wide problems, we must become planetary thinkers.</strong> We must learn how to be humans aware of our natures, our Earthly context and the systems which make up the planet of which we are a part.</p>

<p>Knowledge is dispersed. The miracle of market-based capitalism is that, even though there is no central and complete store of information, information about preferences and demand can be communicated well enough to distribute resources efficiently. But as Hayek points out, there are limits to this system:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The peculiar character of the problem of a rational economic order is determined precisely by the fact that the knowledge of the circumstances of which we must make use never exists in concentrated or integrated form but solely as the dispersed bits of incomplete and frequently contradictory knowledge which all the separate individuals possess. The economic problem of society is thus not merely a problem of how to allocate “given” resources—if “given” is taken to mean given to a single mind which deliberately solves the problem set by these “data.” It is rather a problem of how to secure the best use of resources known to any of the members of society, for ends whose relative importance only these individuals know. Or, to put it briefly, it is a problem of the utilization of knowledge which is not given to anyone in its totality.</p>
