<ol>
<li>Space is the join
<ul>
<li>Data that is situated in space has a unique advantage over all other data: no matter how or why it was originally collected, observations can be connected (&ldquo;joined&rdquo; in database language) by latitude, longitude (and height, and sometimes time)</li>
<li>Spatial data is therefore different from other, more abstract collections, because it carries its own index with it; the value of this is central</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Value derives from combination
<ul>
<li>Building on the previous, spatial data offers opportunities for combination across multiple layers and sources that vastly exceeds other domains</li>
<li>It is in these combinations that breakthrough value emerges, as questions can often be answered as soon as the right combination of observations is brought into mutual alignment</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No secret languages
<ul>
<li>Expertise is worthy of respect, but only if it is used to improve outcomes rather than to exclude newcomers from participating</li>
<li>Much of the jargon and concepts in a field have analogs in other domains, and we should seek these out in order to build bridges</li>
<li>Solving the problems of an interdependent world will require collaboration between communities of expertise that have never worked together before</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mind your uncertainties
<ul>
<li>Data is produced by people, processes, and machines, all of which are specific and fallible</li>
<li>At the most basic level, never lose sight of the data generating process and its impact on the observations in hand</li>
<li>More specifically, track the uncertainty associated with your data throughout the lifecycle of its use</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t breathe the exhaust fumes
<ul>
<li>Data is not god-given; it is created</li>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t have the data you need, or if you need to use fancy math, consider collecting it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Embrace sousveillance capitalism
<ul>
<li>Sousveillance (observing the powerful from below) is morally very different from surveillance; we must not shy away from sousveillance because of our righteous discomfort with surveillance</li>
<li>Sousveillance, especially when pervasive, is a massive check on power and abuse</li>
<li>If we only knew what we could know by seeing&hellip;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Claim the commons
<ul>
<li>There is immense value waiting to be recognized if we have the courage and wisdom to ascertain our surroundings</li>
<li>There will be resistance from powerful interests as this value is captured by the public; this is an existential fight, and we must not shy from it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stop at the front door
<ul>
<li>Contra surveillance capitalism, our interest does not extend into the household or to individual decisions</li>
<li>We enable better decisions at the micro level by improving the information environment in which those decisions are made</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Remember that we are unseeing, not evil
<ul>
<li>The most destructive narrative that reactionary and predatory forces push is that humans are fundamentally greedy, selfish, brutish - that these qualities are innate and universal</li>
<li>By this reading, we are failing to respond to the climate crisis because it is not in our nature to act collectively to do so</li>
<li>But we are not acting because we are not aware of the situation - not at the civilizational level; the task is to build the senses we need</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Perception is the ballgame
<ul>
<li>At the individual level, it is easy to understand the situation, but often hard to know what to do</li>
<li>But at a societal level, it is hard to properly apprehend our circumstances; once this awareness is achieved, the proper response will be almost automatic</li>
</ul>
</li>
