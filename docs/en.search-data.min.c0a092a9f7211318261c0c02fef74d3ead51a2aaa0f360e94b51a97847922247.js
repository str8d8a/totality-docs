While it is necessary to draw some distinctions in the world (and to maintain enough information to allow downstream users to make finer distinctions as required by their application), Totality itself aims to make do with as few concepts and categories as it can.\nThis dictated by aesthetic concerns, to be sure, but also by practical constraints: as a massively multiplayer platform, Totality must be legible to people of many different backgrounds and motivations. Every additional complexity in its external face will reduce the number who are willing and able to engage with it - whether as contributors or consumers.\nThe concepts and entities explained here therefore constitute the minimal set that is capable of representing the natural and man-made world without truly ugly contortions.\nTypes Totality attempts to describe the natural and man-made worlds with as few concepts as possible.\n  Facility\n  Reservoir\n  Reading\n  Process\n  Resource\n  Ecosystem service\n  Conveyance\n  Route\n  "});index.add({'id':3,'href':'/docs/concepts/ontology/reservoir/','title':"Reservoir",'content':""});index.add({'id':4,'href':'/docs/concepts/axiology/','title':"Axiology",'content':"The Theory (And Practice) Of Value Axiology is often described as the theory of value - both what is morally and ethically right, as well as what is intrinsically good (often shorthanded as \u0026ldquo;beauty). In Totality, we seek to create a system that helps our society to answer these questions: What do we value? How do our built systems embody those values? How can we enact new policies and programs to maximize these outcomes? What tools can we provide to help individuals make better decisions.\nIn addition to delivering functionality that bears on axiological reasoning, Totality is itself software that is for something - in particular, for the health and resilience of life on earth. This is its primary goal, and all of the decisions about its design flow from this starting place. In other words, Totality has a strong axiological stance - it is an embodiment of a set of opinions about what is worth doing.\nBut there is more to say beyond this blunt statement of intent, because in any real-world system there are tradeoffs. Even though many situations are not zero sum, there are always key aspects of a situation that demand choices - about priority and focus, and often literal resource allocation as well.\nHow do we know what do we care about? It has long been noted that stated preferences - what we say we value and believe - are often much less reliable than so-called revealed preferences - how we act when we have skin in the game. Government budgets, for example, tell us much more about a society\u0026rsquo;s priorities than rhetoric. Economic and financial measures - GDP, stock prices, compensation - also shed light in a way that PR releases and mission statements do not. The design and evolution of software platforms lay bare the goals of their makers and owners.\nBelow are the basic value statements behind the design and development of Totality, with the obvious caveat that these points are only significant to the extent that they are implemented in the actual construction of the platform.\nSoftware for Civilization Not for individuals (consumers), or for businesses (enterprise), or for the public sector. Also a different relationship with users: to the extent that individuals will interact with the platform - and they will - their experience is important, both for its own sake and because it is critical to the success of the platform as a whole.\nBut the platform itself is pitched to the needs of civilization, a level of organization that is larger than any entity for which software has been written before.\nAccessibility Maximalism Why have systems like Totality not already emerged? The existing contexts in which software systems of its scale and ambition have all carried incentives that are directly at odds with its emergence - that is, they have all contained specific pressures that have guided their progeny in other directions. (Examples: independent or venture-backed, internal growth initiatives, government initiatives).\nIn particular, none of these environments are capable of producing - are not interested in producing - software platforms that are both sustainable and available for the widest possible range of uses.\nThe closest may be Google products such as Google Maps - high quality, broadly available, probably sustainable. But there are still many uses which are effectively banned, and in particular any use which requires broader access patterns. This is even more true in adjacent products such as street view, where many commercial derivatives are effectively prohibited through API access patterns.\nIn general, any business or organization that does not place as its first priority the broad dissemination of high quality data will place significant restrictions on the access and use of the data it does provide. This is because data is, first and foremost, an early input to value-generating activities. Any entity that seeks to maximize its value generation (and capture) will therefore reserve for itself certain internal uses or distribution channels. While this makes perfect sense from the point of view of the entity, it is anathema to the creation of a reliable, sustainable, high-quality public good.\nPlatform First There is a strong bias in the (venture backed) startup world toward vertical solutions, meaning the development of software products that deliver value to a specific, well-defined cohort of users (and their associated buyers). This is in contrast to horizontal solutions, which provide a certain degree of value to a wide range of users who span different applications, domain, use cases, or sectors. The conventional wisdom is that a company or organization with \u0026ldquo;platform\u0026rdquo; ambitions should first prove its mettle in or more verticals before extending itself horizontally. And this isn\u0026rsquo;t wrong, especially in the context of a company that has raised venture-type funding - and that, in doing so, has taken on the growth expectations of venture investors.\nTotality directly questions this wisdom: its goal is the broadest possible dissemination of high-quality knowledge about the planet\u0026rsquo;s natural and man-made realms. It is not that Totality is not interested in the applications of its output - but, rather, that the more lucrative or straightforwardly profitable of these applications must not be allowed to crowd out those whose benefits primarily accrue in the environmental, civic, or cultural sectors. In other words, the operating model must include a radical commitment to not attempting to capture most of the value that is created. This is, needless to say, entirely and understandably at odds with most investors\u0026rsquo; expectations.\nIndependent and self-sustaining Given the above admonitions, one might assume that Totality should seek support from grant-making entities such as foundations or even the government. But these entities have their own agendas, theses, and processes. Sustaining grant-based funding is notoriously time consuming and unpredictable, and is therefore not a good fit for an effort that aims to build a multi-decade, institutional public good.\nIf equity investment and foundation-style support are both off the table, then what is left? While it\u0026rsquo;s true that there are no solutions ready to be pulled off the shelf, there are many reasons to believe that Totality can reach and maintain self-sustaining status early in its lifecycle.\nInstitutional Startup Cultivating Healthy and Resilient Systems "});index.add({'id':5,'href':'/docs/concepts/','title':"Concepts",'content':"Tot∀litY Philosophy of Science Crash Course Totality is a software system, but its most important aspects are its philosophy, principles, and goals. Totality uses technologies that are widely available, cost-effective, and scalable: the public cloud, edge devices, remote sensing, mobile computing, and so on. But it combines these familiar pieces in new ways and, in particular, to new ends.\nTotality is made from the same bits and atoms as many other systems; if you were to look at its \u0026ldquo;parts list\u0026rdquo;, everything would look quite pedestrian. But purpose and material are quite different concerns, and it is in purpose where Totality is truly new.\nIn classical philosophy of science, questions are divided into three domains.\nAxiology includes questions of value: what is important? How are different notions and degrees of importance compared, and how might decisions be made between options when resources are scarce? Axiology includes both ethics - what is right action? what ought we to do? - and aesthetics - what is \u0026ldquo;beautiful\u0026rdquo;, meaning worthy on its own terms?\nEpistemology concerns what we know, how we come to know it, how we should relate to that knowledge. Crucially, epistemology also covers uncertainty - how sure or unsure should we be about a claim? When should we feel comfortable acting, and when should we wait and seek out more evidence?\nOntology is all about the nature of being - what exists, the categories that things fall into, and how items and their categories interact. In computer science and IT, the concept of ontologies has been extended to include some very detailed domain-specific hierarchies; we, though, are more interested in the fundamental idea of ontology.\nThe Philosophy of Totality All three of these lenses can be applied to understanding Totality as an overall system.\nStarting with ontology, which is a common concern for software and data systems; all data modeling is a de facto (and frequently de jure) ontological exercise - a dividing up of the modeled universe into entities and their relations.\nEpistemology, too, is not foreign to computer science, though it makes fewer explicit appearances in the literature and consciousness of the field. This is largely a result of the relevant history: early computer systems were developed within controlled, institutional contexts. While the personal and mobile computing eras have both been underway for some time, databases have remained relatively centralized. But this obscures the fact that the information within them is increasingly created, curated, and consumed by many, many people. And it is widely understood now that our methods for sense-making and truth evaluation have fallen way behind our tools for gathering and disseminating that information.\nAnd finally, axiology has been largely absent from the computing discussion. Or, more accurately, it has been confined to specific corners of the discourse. Computing ethics has been narrowly construed, mostly concerned with how software systems should be built and tested in order to prevent harm to users and bystanders. This is important - radiation overdoses, rockets exploding from control failures, and privacy breaches are all essential to avoid. But if these specific and easily characterizable harms are the primary focus, then systems that function \u0026ldquo;properly\u0026rdquo; can still cause harm - or fail to deliver the benefits that differently-motivated alternatives would bring. Crucially, many of these ethical discussions happen outside of the software and hardware practitioner communities.\nAesthetics has a rich basis in computing, starting from the earliest days of system design and extending into the present day. Computer scientists and software engineers have endless judgments about the beauty, elegance, and rightness of the languages and technologies they use. But these judgments only rarely extend from the internal structure of those systems to their brodaer impacts on the world.\nTotality draws from all of these wells. As a system for capturing and making available complete, accurate, and up-to-date information about many aspects of the planet, it is clearly dependent on both ontological and epistemological concepts. Like any system which attempts to model key aspects of the real world, Totality\u0026rsquo;s method of dividing the world into entities and their relationships is central to its function and performance. But as a system that incorporates observations from an extremely diverse array of sources, Totality must also take epistemological concerns very seriously. How should observations be weighted on an individual basis? How do different observations - different sources, different collection methods, different times - be combined and compared? How does reliability change over time? When should beliefs be called into question as a result of knew observations? For Totality to achieve its goals, the system must include specific facilities to address these and other questions about the nature and reliability of the information it processes.\nAnd finally, Totality cannot be properly understood or further developed without intense focus on axiological concerns - what is valuable, what should be done, and how tradeoffs should be made along the way. While this is unusual today, it should become less so. As a new discipline, computing - and, especially, networked computing - has been primarily concerned with what is possible (and how to build it). But it is time, probably past time, for questions about what should be built to take center stage. If we take for granted the fact that networked computing systems can have a huge effect on every aspect of our lives and the health of our planet, we must foreground the questions of where and to what aims we should be applying our efforts.\nTotality is, today, unusual in its preoccupation with these issues, but this is intended to be a point of leadership rather than long term differentiation. Software is powerful, and it is indeed eating the world. But the honeymoon is over, and it is time to act like it.\n"});index.add({'id':6,'href':'/docs/','title':"Docs",'content':""});index.add({'id':7,'href':'/docs/principles/','title':"Principles for Designing on Totality",'content':"Guidelines For Designing With Totality  Space is the join  Data that is situated in space has a unique advantage over all of ther data: no matter how it is collected, different observations can be connected (\u0026ldquo;joined\u0026rdquo; in database language) by latitude, longitude (and height, and sometimes time) Spatial data is therefore different from other, more abstract collections, because it carries its own index with it; the value of this is central   Value comes from combination  Building on the previous, spatial data offers opportunities for combination across multiple layers and sources that vastly exceeds other domains It is in these combinations that breakthrough value emerges, as questions can often be answered as soon as the right combination of observations is brought into mutual alignment   No secret languages  Expertise is worthy of respect, but only if it is used to improve outcomes rather than to exclude Much of the jargon and concepts in a field have analogs in other domains, and we should seek these out in order to build bridges   Mind your uncertainties  Data is produced by people, processes, and machines, all of which are specific and fallible At the most basic level, never lose sight of the data generating process and its impact on the observations in hand More specifically, track the uncertainty associated with your data throughout the lifecycle of its use   Don\u0026rsquo;t breathe the exhaust fumes  Data is not god-given; it is created If you don\u0026rsquo;t have the data you need, or if you need to use fancy math, consider collecting it   Embrace sousveillance capitalism  Sousveillance (observing the powerful from below) is morally very different from surveillance; we must not shy away from sousveillance because of our righteous discomfort with surveillance Sousveillance, especially when pervasive, is a massive check on power and abuse If we only knew what we could know by seeing\u0026hellip;   Claim the commons  There is immense value waiting to be recognized if we have the courage and wisdom to ascertain our surroundings There will be resistance from powerful interests as this value is captured by the public; this is an existential fight, and we must not shy from it   Stop at the front door  Contra surveillance capitalism, our interest does not extend into the household or to individual decisions We enable better decisions at the micro level by improving the information environment in which those decisions are made   Remember that we are unseeing, not evil  The most destructive narrative that reactionary and predatory forces push is that humans are fundamentally greedy, selfish, brutish - that these qualities are innate and universal By this reading, we are failing to respond to the climate crisis because it is not in our nature to act collectively to do so But we are not acting because we are not aware of the situation - not at the civilizational level; the task is to build the senses we need   Perception is the ballgame  At the individual level, it is easy to understand the situation, but often hard to know what to do But at a societal level, it is hard to properly apprehend our circumstances; once this awareness is achieved, the proper response will be almost automatic    "});})();
